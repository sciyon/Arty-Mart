# Arty Mart

Arty Mart is an app designed to empower artists by providing them with a platform to showcase and sell their artwork directly to a global audience. 

Arty Mart is made using [Vite React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for the storage of the images.
